        <p>Sydney was incorporated in 1842 as Australia's first city. Gold was discovered in the colony in 1851, and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money. Sydney became one of the most multicultural cities in the world after the mass migration following the second World War. According to the 2011 census, more than 250 different languages are spoken in Sydney and about 40 percent of residents speak a language other than English at home.
